Installation Guide
==================

First you have to clone from the `Github Repo <https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/nigplanet>`_.
To do that just type in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/bigplanet.git

Afterwards, go into the directory (bigplanet) and run the setup script:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd bigplanet
    python setup.py install


The setup script installs the various dependencies and allows bigplanet to be
ran from the command line as well as be imported as a module.
