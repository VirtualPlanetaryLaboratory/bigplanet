BigPlanet
-----
A suite of data analysis and extraction routines for ``VPLanet`` designed to be used
with `vspace <../vspace>`_ and `multi-planet <../multi-planet>`_ scripts. It can also
generate files for use with the `VR Ulysses virtual reality data explorer
<https://www.vrulysses.com>`_.

Installation
============
Navigate to the BigPlanet directory (this directory) and run the ``setup`` script
by entering ``python setup.py install``, which installs various dependencies and allows
BigPlanet to be run from the command line (see running bigplanet section below)

Running BigPlanet
=================
BigPlanet has two primary uses: 1) a command line tool to generate an `HDF5
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`_  file that stores
and the data in a compressed format, and 2) a python module that enables data
extraction and plotting from the HDF5 file.  These are explained in
detail below.

Command Line Usage
==================
Using BigPlanet on the command line is relatively straight forward. After a suite of
simulations (set up with `vspace <../vspace>`_) has completed, simply run the following
command in the in the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    bigplanet <input file> -c [number of cores] -q -m [email]

where the input file is the same file used to run vspace and multi-planet.
There are three optional arguments:
:code:`-c` : the number of processors used
:code:`-q` : quiet mode (nothing is printed to the command line)
:code:`-m` : emails the user when Bigplanet is complete

Module Usage
============
Using BigPlanet as a module is where majority of the *magic* happens. To start,
import BigPlanet as a module:

.. code-block:: python

    import bigplanet as bp

This allows you to use the various functions that are outlined in detail below, such as
print all the names of the variables (the "keys") in the HDF5 file (PrintKeys), extract a particular
variable from its key (ExtractColumn), extract the units of a particular key value
(ExtractUnits), extract unique values in a particular key (ExtractUniqueValues),
create a matrix based on two keys (CreateMatrix), and write out a list of keys
to a file (WriteOutput).


.. note::

    Keys using the following format for naming: body_variable_aggregation


**PrintKeys**

PrintKeys, as the name suggests, simply that prints all available keys. Keys, as mentioned above,
are the names of various variables that can be extracted. It takes in the following arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    PrintKeys(HDF5_File)

where *HDF5_File* is the name of the HDF5 file, which is used like so:

.. code-block:: python

    HDF5_File = h5py.File(filename, 'r')



**ExtractColumn**

ExtractColumn is a function that returns all of values of a particular column in the
HDF5 file. It takes the following arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    ExtractColumn(HDF5_File,Key)

where:

*HDF5_File* is the name of the HDF5 file

*Key* is the name of the particular variable you are extracting the units from.

See the `Understanding Keys`_ Section for an indepth look at the types of key options available.



**ExtractUnits**

ExtractUnits is a function that returns the units of a particular column in the
HDF5 file. It takes the following arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    ExtractUnits(HDF5_File,Key)

where:

*HDF5_File* is the name of the HDF5 file

*Key* is the name of the particular variable you are extracting the units from.

See the `Understanding Keys`_ Section for an indepth look at the types of key options available.



**ExtractUniqueValues**

ExtractUniqueValues is a function that returns a list of unique values in a key provided.
It takes the following arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    ExtractUniqueValues(HDF5_File,Key)

where:

*HDF5_File* is the name of the HDF5 file

*Key* is the name of the particular variable you are extracting the units from.

**CreateHDF5File**

CreateHDF5File is a function that creates an HDF5 file from the input file that is passed
to the function. This is mainly used if you forgot to run bigplanet or want to run all
the code for bigplanet in module format

.. code-block:: python

    CreateHDF5File(inputfile)

where:

*inputfile* is the same file used to run vspace and multi-planet


**CreateMatrix**

CreateMatrix is a function that returns the zaxis for a 3D matrix. This is useful
for plotting Contour Plots of the data extracted. CreateMatrix takes the following
arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    CreateMatrix(xaxis,yaxis,zarray,orientation=1)

where:

*xaxis* is the ExtractUniqueValues() of the column you want the xaxis to be

*yaxis* is the ExtractUniqueValues() of the column you want the xaxis to be

*zarray* is the ExtractColumn() of what you want the zaxis to be

*orientation* is the orientation of the data based on a 4 quadrant grid that
goes counter clockwise in 90 degree interments. The default is 1, or bottom left corner.



**WriteOutput**

WriteOutput is a function that writes the list of columns to an output file. Headers
are optional. WriteOutput takes the following arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    WriteOutput(inputfile, columns, file="bigplanet.out", delim=" ", header=False, ulysses=False)

where:

*inputfile* is the name of the HDF5 file

*columns* is the list of keys you are extracting (Use the same format as ExtractColumn, ExtractUnits and
ExtractUniqueValues)

*File* is the name of the output file

*delim* is the delimiter for the output file (the default is spaces)

*header* adds the names and units for each column (default is False)

*ulysses* makes the file compatable with VR Ulysses (default is False)



Understanding Keys
==================
Keys are the bread and butter of BigPlanet. The keys, as briefly mentioned above,
are the names of the various variables that BigPlanet has extracted from the forward file
and the log file that are generated when VPLanet finishes compiling.


.. note::

	  Keys using the following format for naming: body_variable_aggregation

    The following aggregations will **only** work with parameters that are
    from the *forward* file.

    it will produce an error.
